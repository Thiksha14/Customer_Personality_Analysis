Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns of different types of customers. It also helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyse which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

Uses Principal Component Analysis to reduce feature space and visualize high-dimensional customer data in 2D.

- Cluster Visualization
Displays a clear and colorful 2D scatter plot of clustered customers.

- Built with Only Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn & Streamlit
No external ML libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch used — clean and lightweight!
